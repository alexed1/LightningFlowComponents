# A Note about SFDX

This repo contains code structured as sfdx projects. However, you don't have to use SFDX in order to access these components. Each component has its own folder inside force_app/main/default/aura, and you can simply copy and paste the component files to your development environment and deploy your usual way. That said, we recommend you give SFDX a try. It makes deployment of components like these a matter of a few command line keystrokes, and we think it's wonderful. Also, it's free. Learn more at:
