# Unique name for this workflow
name: Validate PR on develop branch

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
    # The workflow will run whenever an event happens on a pull request
    pull_request:
      # The events are that a PR is opened, or when a commit is pushed
      # to a branch that has an existing pull request
      types: [opened, synchronize]
      # The branches filter allows to specify that this workflow should only
      # run if the branch name is "develop". This way we prevent this workflow
      # from running when PRs are opened on other branches
      branches: [ develop ]
      # We only care about changes to the force-app directory, which is the
      # root directory of the sfdx project. This prevents the job from running
      # when changing non-salesforce files (like this yml file).
